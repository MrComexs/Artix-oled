# Artix-custom
This is my custom artix theme.

my plan is to make this theme black for every element

so far I haven't finish it yet but for the moist part it is mostly done.

I do plan to make a a theme/style instead of replacing the files in artix-dark 

# Install
move to your `/usr/share/theme/Artix-dark/gtk-3.0/` folder and replace the old gtk.ccs
