# Artix-oled
This is my custom Artix-oled theme.

my plan is to make this theme black for every element

so far I haven't finish it yet but for the moist part it is mostly done.

I do plan to make a a theme/style instead of replacing the files in artix-dark 

# Installation
do note that isn't done so you might not be able to see elements since I don't know what I am doing.

move to your `/usr/share/theme/Artix-dark/gtk-3.0/` folder and replace the old gtk.ccs

# Changes need to be made
- Fix gradient window frame
- Fix gradient buttons
- Fix text entry box
